AB  - Aims: Bubble entropy (bEn) is an entropy metric with a limited dependence on 
      parameters. bEn does not directly quantify the conditional entropy of the series, 
      but it assesses the change in entropy of the ordering of portions of its samples 
      of length m, when adding an extra element. The analytical formulation of bEn for 
      autoregressive (AR) processes shows that, for this class of processes, the 
      relation between the first autocorrelation coefficient and bEn changes for odd 
      and even values of m. While this is not an issue, per se, it triggered ideas for 
      further investigation. Methods: Using theoretical considerations on the expected 
      values for AR processes, we examined a two-steps-ahead estimator of bEn, which 
      considered the cost of ordering two additional samples. We first compared it with 
      the original bEn estimator on a simulated series. Then, we tested it on real 
      heart rate variability (HRV) data. Results: The experiments showed that both 
      examined alternatives showed comparable discriminating power. However, for values 
      of 10<m<20, where the statistical significance of the method was increased and 
      improved as m increased, the two-steps-ahead estimator presented slightly higher 
      statistical significance and more regular behavior, even if the dependence on 
      parameter m was still minimal. We also investigated a new normalization factor 
      for bEn, which ensures that bEn&nbsp;=1 when white Gaussian noise (WGN) is given 
      as the input. Conclusions: The research improved our understanding of bubble 
      entropy, in particular in the context of HRV analysis, and we investigated 
      interesting details regarding the definition of the estimator.
